        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
            Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
            a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
            a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, 
            though, the unity and coherence of ideas among 
            sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or
            a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
            Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in
            a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, 
            particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one 
            sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group 
            of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, 
            we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because 
            it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

        <h2>Section two</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine each paragraph as a sandwich. 
            The real content of the sandwich—the 
            meat or other filling—is in the middle. 
            It includes all the evidence you need to make the point. 
            But it gets kind of messy to eat a sandwich without any bread. 
            Your readers don’t know what to do with all the evidence you’ve given them. 
            So, the top slice of bread (the first sentence of the paragraph) explains 
            the topic (or controlling idea) of the paragraph. And, the bottom slice 
            (the last sentence of the paragraph) tells the reader how the paragraph 
            relates to the broader argument. In the original and revised paragraphs below, 
            notice how a topic sentence expressing the controlling idea tells the reader 
            the point of all the evidence.
